# Bring your own app example

An end-to-end example that creates the DevSecOps CI toolchain only. It exposes the minimum amount of variables that should be configured to get a working custom CI toolchain. See the [DevSecOps docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-cd-devsecops-tekton-ci-compliance) for the prerequisites for running the toolchains.

This example requires several additional variables to the ones exposed in the default example. See the example tfvars file for more details
