# Default example

An end-to-end example that creates the DevSecOps CI, CD and CC toolchains. It exposes the minimum amount of variables that should be configured to get a working custom set of DevSecOps toolchains. This is the 'out of the box' setup. See the [DevSecOps docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/devsecops?topic=devsecops-cd-devsecops-tekton-ci-compliance) for the prerequisites for running the toolchains.
